You do not need to compile the code, just run it:
Example command line to run this program:
 python game.py 5 3 false
or
 python game.py 5 3 true


My program contains three subroutines: BFS, A*, Simple A*
the "true" or "false" is used to indicate whether to run BFS or not.

For my heuristic, please reference: http://www.d.umn.edu/~kvanhorn/cs2511/discussions/heuristics.html
